# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  Follow these steps:

2. Edit the `README.md` file to add your entry
3. Make sure your entry follows the format: `- [**Project Name**](URL) - Description`
4. Submit a pull request

## Guidelines

- Entries should be an extension for Gemini CLI (or make use of / do something for extensions)
- Your item should be added to the bottom of the appropriate section

Then you can optionally add a badge to your extension's README:

```
[![Mentioned in Awesome Gemini CLI Extensions](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/awesome-gemini-cli-extensions)
```
[![Mentioned in Awesome Gemini CLI Extensions](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/awesome-gemini-cli-extensions)

There's also a flat version of the badge you can use instead if you prefer:
```
